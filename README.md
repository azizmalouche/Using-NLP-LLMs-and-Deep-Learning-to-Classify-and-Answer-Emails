# Using NLP, LLMs, and Deep Learning to Classify and Answer Emails
Leveraged Natural Language Processing (Python, SpaCy) to analyze 6,800 customer service emails, identifying patterns through unigrams 
and bigrams for more effective categorization. Used a Large Language Model (Llama 3.1) and a Deep Learning Model (BERT) to classify emails 
into seven categories with 81% accuracy. Additionally, automated email responses by extracting key information based on categories, 
reducing manual effort and saving approximately $29 million annually. Shared biweekly updates with the data science team and deployed 
scalable solutions on Amazon SageMaker, ensuring continued usability and optimization.
